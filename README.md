# next-graphql-vercel

This is a simple nextjs/graphql demo-project, complete with integration-tests, graphql-playground & deployment.

A demo deployment is [here](https://next-graphql-vercel.vercel.app)

You can start your own projects using this as a template:

```sh

```

## usage

npm i

# run tests
npm test

```

After you run `npm start`, you can view the GraphQL playground (try queries and see docs) [here](http://localhost:3000/api).
