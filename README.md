# next-graphql-vercel

This is a simple nextjs/graphql demo-project, complete with integration-tests, graphql-playground & deployment.

```sh
# install tools and libraries
npm i

# run tests
npm test

# run local development-server
npm start

# deploy on vercel
npm run deploy
```

After you run `npm start`, you can view the GraphQL playground (try queries and see docs) [here](http://localhost:3000/api).
